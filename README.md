## High-Level Design
### Server
The server architecture is built around a microservices design pattern. It comprises multiple components responsible for distinct tasks. These include:

Authentication Service: Manages user authentication and authorization.
Database Service: Handles database operations, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
Main Service: Acts as the core service, managing the primary functionalities of the application.
The server communicates using RESTful API endpoints, allowing seamless interaction between the client and the server. For the database, a relational database management system (e.g., PostgreSQL) was chosen for its robustness and scalability.

The communication between server and client is established via HTTP and WebSocket protocols. The HTTP protocol is used for general data exchange, while WebSocket ensures real-time bidirectional communication for specific features.

The server employs a modular design to ensure scalability and maintainability. This architecture enables easy integration of additional functionalities and ensures efficient handling of requests from multiple clients concurrently.
